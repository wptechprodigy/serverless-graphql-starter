# Serverless-GraphQL-API-Netlify-Starter-Template

🔥 The basic template for setting up a serverless GraphQL API ready for deploy on Netlify 🔥

## Installation

Clone the repo either using SSH or HTTPS and run either of the command below (I prefer `yarn` - no hard feelings 👍) to install dependencies:

```
yarn
```
or
```
npm install
```

## Locally

To run the project locally run, either:
 (be consistent though 👌)
```
yarn start
```
or
```
npm run start
```

## About

This template is based on a tutorial [here](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/tutorials/deploying-a-serverless-graphql-api-on-netlify/) by [@stemmlerjs](https://twitter.com/stemmlerjs) on  how to use both apollo-server and apollo-server-lambda to setup a server so that you can write your GraphQL resolvers and type definitions in one place, yet run GraphQL servers locally and serverlessly.

Shoutout to [Khalil Stemmler](https://github.com/stemmlerjs) the Domain Driven Design (DDD) Advocate for creating the awesome content.
